# SparkDensityTree

Currently alpha-level, but usable (documentation upcoming). 

This project aims to extend a fast tree-based nonparamteric density estimator in  
[Data Adaptive Histograms for Statistical Regular Pavings](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20161121optMAPMDE.pdf) 
into the distributed fault-tolerant setting provided by Apache Spark.
